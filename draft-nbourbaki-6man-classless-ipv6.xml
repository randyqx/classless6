  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have
    been proposed, with the most notable being Top-Level Aggregation
    (TLA) and Next-Level Aggregation (NLA) Identifiers; see, for
    example, <xref target="RFC2450"/>.  They have all proved to be
    mistakes.  For example, TLA and NLA were obsoleted by <xref
    target="RFC3587"/>.  The last remnant of classful addressing is a 
    rigid network / interface identifier boundary at /64.
    This document removes that boundary as far as routing and addressing
    are concerned.</t>

    <t>Some confusion has been caused by the IP Version 6 Addressing
    Architecture, <xref target="RFC4291"/>, and the proposed changes in
    <xref target="I-D.hinden-6man-rfc4291bis"/> with respect to the
    minimum subnet size.</t>
    
    <t>Meanwhile, link prefixes of varied lengths, /127, /126, /124,
    /120, ... /64 have been successfully deployed for many years.
    Having the formal specification be unclear risks potential
    mis-implementation by the naïve, which could result in operational
    disasters.</t>

    <t>It is assumed that the reader understands the history of classful
    addressing in IPv4 and why it was abolished <xref
    target="RFC4632"/>.  Of course, the acute need to conserve address
    space that forced the adoption of classless addressing for IPv4 does
    not apply to IPv6; but the arguments for operational flexibility in
    address allocation remain compelling.</t>

    <t>NOTE: do we mean 4291bis (currently moribund) or 2464bis?</t>
    
    <t>An important recent development in IPv6 is that for host
    computers on local area networks, the way in which interface
    identifiers are formed is no longer bound to layer 2 addresses (MAC
    addresses) <xref target="RFC7217"/>.  We can therefore appreciate
    that their length, previously fixed at 64 bits <xref
    target="RFC7136"/>, is in fact a free parameter as stated in <xref
    target="RFC4862"/>.</t>

[fgont] We do mean 4291bis. That say, RFC8064/RFC7217 already do part of
the job: they replace the algorithm of "embedding the MAC address in the
IPv6" with one that embeds random bits of an appropriate length. That
is, strictly speaking, we don't een need /64 for SLAAC, except for
backward compatibility. (*)

(*) as long as the local subnet is large enough and the IID collision
rate is low enough.

    <t>An important recent IPv6 development was that, for host computers
    on local area networks, the way in which interface identifiers were
    formed was no longer bound to layer 2 addresses (MACs) <xref

    length, previously fixed at 64 bits <xref target="RFC7136"/>, is in

<<<<<<< HEAD
    <t>To state it simply, IPv6 unicast routing is based on prefixes of
    any valid length up to 128 except for links where an Internet
    Standard that has nothing to do with routing may impose a
    particular length. Examples are Stateless Address AutoConfiguration
    <xref target="RFC4862"/>, or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on
    Inter-Router Links <xref target="RFC6164"/>.</t>

    <t>To state it simply, IPv6 unicast subnetting is based on prefixes
    of any valid length up to 128 except for links where an Internet
    Standard such as, for example, Stateless Address AutoConfiguration
    (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/>, or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on
    Inter-Router Links <xref target="RFC6164"/> is in use.</t>
>>>>>>> origin/master

    <t>Nodes must always support routing on any valid network prefix
    length, even if SLAAC or other standards are in use, because routing
    could choose to differentiate at a different granularity than is
    used by any such automated link local address configuration
    tools.</t>

<!-- [fgont] I think these section is mixing up to things:

* Routing: Nodes must *always* support rotuing on any valid length, even
           if, say, SLAAC is in use.  Even when SLAAC is used, I might
           want to install a host-specific rule (a /128 rule), if I
           please. And I think this point has never been contended
           (except for vendors that go lazy/cheap and just don't want to
           use mre than 64-bits in each FIB entry.

* Subnet size: This is what you're really referring to here. Nodes
               should be able to employ any subnet size that they
               please, except when slaac is in use (for backwards
               compatibility) or e.g. when /127 (or the like) prefixes
               are employed for point to point links.  --> </section>

  <section anchor="notes" title="Recommendations">

    <t>For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link,
    barring other considerations, a /64 is recommended <xref
    target="RFC7136"/>.</t>

    <t>The length of the Interface Identifier in Stateless Address
    AutoConfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"/> is a parameter; its
    length SHOULD be sufficient for effective randomization for privacy
    reasons.  For example, a /48 might be sufficient.  But operationally
    we recommend, barring strong considerations to the contrary, using
    64-bits for SLAAC in order not to discover bugs where 64 was
    hard-coded, and to favor portability of devices and operating
    systems.</t>
    
    <t>None the less, there is no reason in theory why an IPv6 node
    should not operate with different interface identfier lengths on
    different physical interfaces.  Thus, a correct implementation of
    SLAAC must in fact allow for any prefix length, with the value being
    a parameter per interface.  For instance, the Interface Identifier
    length in the recommended (see <xref target="RFC8064"/>) algorithm
    for selecting stable interface identifiers <xref target="RFC7217"/>
    is a parameter, rather than a hardcoded value.</t>
    
    </section>

  <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

    <t>Assumming that nodes employ unpredictable interface identifiers
    <xref target="RFC7721"/>, the subnet size may have an impact on some
    security and privacy properties of a network.  Namely, the smaller
    the subnet size, the more feasible it becomes to perform IPv6
    address scans <xref target="RFC7707"/> <xref target="RFC7721"/>.
    For some specific subnets, such as point to point links, this may be
    less of an issue.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, we assume that a number of IPv6
    implementations fail to enforce limits on the size of some of the
    data structures they employ for communicating with neighboring
    nodes, such as the Neighbor Cache.  In such cases, the use of
    smaller subnets forces an operational limit on such data structures,
    thus helping mitigate some pathological behaviors (such as Neighbor
    Cache Exhaustion attacks).</t>
