  <abstract>

    <t>Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
    proposed, none of which has withstood the test of time.  The last
    remnant of IPv6 classful addressing is a rigid network interface
    identifier boundary at /64.  This document removes the fixed position of
    that boundary for interface addressing.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>Over the history of the IPv6 protocol, several classful addressing
    models have been proposed.  The most notable example recommended Top-Level
    Aggregation (TLA) and Next-Level Aggregation (NLA) Identifiers <xref
    target="RFC2450"/>, but was obsoleted by <xref target="RFC3587"/>, leaving
    a single remnant of classful addressing in IPv6: a rigid network
    interface identifier boundary at /64.  This document removes the fixed
    position of that boundary for interface addressing.</t>

    <t>Recent proposed changes to the IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture
    specification <xref target="RFC4291"/> have caused controversy.
    While link prefixes of varied lengths, e.g.  /127, /126, /124,
    /120, ...  /64 have been successfully deployed for many years, glaring
    mismatches between a formal specification and long-standing field
    deployment practices are never wise, not least because of the strong
    risk of mis-implementation, which can easily result in serious
    operational problems.</t>

    <t>This document also clarifies that IPv6 routing subnets may be of any
    length up to 128.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="reading" title="Suggested Reading">

    <t>It is assumed that the reader understands the history of classful
    addressing in IPv4 and why it was abolished <xref
    target="RFC4632"/>.  Of course, the acute need to conserve address
    space that forced the adoption of classless addressing for IPv4 does
    not apply to IPv6, but the arguments for operational flexibility in
    address assignment remain compelling.</t>

    <t>It is also assumed that the reader understands IPv6 <xref
    target="RFC2460"/>, the IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture <xref
    target="RFC4291"/>, the proposed changes to RFC4291 <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc4291bis"/> and RFC2464
    <xref target="I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis"/>, and the IETF
    recommendation for the generation of stable Interface Identifiers
    <xref target="RFC8064"/>.</t>

<!--     
    <t>NOTE: do we mean 4291bis (currently moribund) or 2464bis?</t>

[fgont] We do mean 4291bis. That say, RFC8064/RFC7217 already do part of
the job: they replace the algorithm of "embedding the MAC address in the
IPv6" with one that embeds random bits of an appropriate length. That
is, strictly speaking, we don't een need /64 for SLAAC, except for
backward compatibility. (*)

(*) as long as the local subnet is large enough and the IID collision
rate is low enough. 
-->

    <t>For host computers on local area networks, generation of interface
    identifiers is no longer necessarily bound to layer 2 addresses (MACs)
    <xref target="RFC7217"/> <xref target="RFC8064"/>.  Therefore their
    length, previously fixed at 64 bits <xref target="RFC7136"/>, is in fact
    a variably-sized parameter as explicitly acknowledged in Section
    5.5.3(d) of <xref target="RFC4862"/> which states:

      <list><t>
      Note that a future revision of the address architecture [RFC4291]
      and a future link-type-specific document, which will still be
      consistent with each other, could potentially allow for an
      interface identifier of length other than the value defined in the
      current documents.  Thus, an implementation should not assume a
      particular constant.  Rather, it should expect any lengths of
      interface identifiers.
      </t></list>

    </t>
    </section>

  <section anchor="statement" title="Identifier and Subnet Length Statements">

    <t>IPv6 unicast interfaces may use any subnet length up to 128 except
    for situations where an Internet Standard document may impose a
    particular length, for example Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/>, or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on
    Inter-Router Links <xref target="RFC6164"/>.</t>

    <t>Additionally, this document clarifies that a node or router MUST
    support routing of any valid network prefix length, even if SLAAC or
    other standards are in use, because routing could choose to
    differentiate at a different granularity than is used by any such
    automated link local address configuration tools.</t>

<!-- [fgont] I think these section is mixing up to things:

* Routing: Nodes must *always* support rotuing on any valid length, even
           if, say, SLAAC is in use.  Even when SLAAC is used, I might
           want to install a host-specific rule (a /128 rule), if I
           please. And I think this point has never been contended
           (except for vendors that go lazy/cheap and just don't want to
           use mre than 64-bits in each FIB entry.

* Subnet size: This is what you're really referring to here. Nodes
               should be able to employ any subnet size that they
               please, except when slaac is in use (for backwards
               compatibility) or e.g. when /127 (or the like) prefixes
               are employed for point to point links.

  <section anchor="notes" title="Recommendations">

    <t>For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link,
    barring other considerations, a /64 is recommended <xref
    target="RFC7136"/>.</t>

    <t>The length of the Interface Identifier in Stateless Address
    Autoconfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"/> is a parameter; its
    length SHOULD be sufficient for effective randomization for privacy
    reasons.  For example, a /48 might be sufficient.  But operationally
    we recommend, barring strong considerations to the contrary, using
    64-bits for SLAAC in order not to discover bugs where 64 was
    hard-coded, and to favor portability of devices and operating
    systems.</t>

    <t>Nonetheless, there is no reason in theory why an IPv6 node
    should not operate with different interface identfier lengths on
    different physical interfaces.  Thus, a correct implementation of
    SLAAC must in fact allow for any prefix length, with the value being
    a parameter per interface.  For instance, the Interface Identifier
    length in the recommended (see <xref target="RFC8064"/>) algorithm
    for selecting stable interface identifiers <xref target="RFC7217"/>
    is a parameter, rather than a hardcoded value.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

    <t>Assuming that nodes employ unpredictable interface identifiers
    <xref target="RFC7721"/>, the subnet size may have an impact on some
    security and privacy properties of a network.  Namely, the smaller
    the subnet size, the more feasible it becomes to perform IPv6
    address scans <xref target="RFC7707"/> <xref target="RFC7721"/>.
    For some specific subnets, such as point to point links, this may be
    less of an issue.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, we assume that a number of IPv6
    implementations fail to enforce limits on the size of some of the
    data structures they employ for communicating with neighboring
    nodes, such as the Neighbor Cache.  In such cases, the use of
    smaller subnets forces an operational limit on such data structures,
    thus helping mitigate some pathological behaviors (such as Neighbor
    Cache Exhaustion attacks).</t>
