                 draft-bourbaki-6man-classless-ipv6-00

Abstract

   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
   proposed, maybe the most notable being Top-Level Aggregation (TLA)
   and Next-Level Aggregation (NLA) Identifiers.  They have all proved
   to be mistakes.  The last remnant is a rigid boundary at /64.  This
   document removes that boundary as far as routing and addressing are
   concerned.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed

1.  Introduction

   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
   proposed, maybe the most notable being Top-Level Aggregation (TLA)
   and Next-Level Aggregation (NLA) Identifiers; see, for example,
   [RFC2450].  They have all proved to be mistakes.  For example, TLA
   and NLA were obsoleted by [RFC3587].  The last remnant is a rigid
   boundary at /64.  This document removes that boundary as far as
   routing and addressing are concerned.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the history of classful
   addressing in IPv4 and why it was abolished [RFC4632].  Of course,
   the acute need to conserve address space that forced the adoption of
   classless addressing for IPv4 does not apply to IPv6; but the
   arguments for operational flexibility in address allocation remain
   compelling.

   It is also assumed that the reader understands IPv6 [RFC2460], the IP
   Version 6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291], the proposed changes to

   RFC4291 [I-D.hinden-6man-rfc4291bis], and the recent recommendations
   for the generation of stable Interface Identifiers [RFC8064].

   An important recent IPv6 development was that, for host computers on
   local area networks, the way in which interface identifiers were
   formed was no longer bound to layer 2 addresses (MACs) [RFC7217]
   [RFC8064].  Therefore their length, previously fixed at 64 bits
   [RFC7136], is in fact a free parameter as stated in [RFC4862].

3.  Background

   Some confusion has been caused by the IP Version 6 Addressing
   Architecture, [RFC4291], and the proposed changes in
   [I-D.hinden-6man-rfc4291bis] with respect to the minimum subnet size.

   Meanwhile, link prefixes of varied lengths, /127, /126, /124, /120,
   ... /64 have been successfully deployed for many years.  Having the
   formal specification be unclear risks potential mis-implementation by
   the naive, which could result in operational disasters.

4.  A simple Statement

   To state it simply, IPv6 unicast subnetting is based on prefixes of
   any valid length up to 128 except for links where an Internet
   Standard such as, for example, Stateless Address AutoConfiguration
   [RFC4862], or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links
   [RFC6164] is in use.

   Nodes must always support rotuing on any valid length, even if SLAAC
   or other standards are in use because routing could choose to
   differentiate at a different granularity.

5.  Recommendations

   For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link, barring
   other considerations, a /64 is RECOMMENDED [RFC7136].

   The length of the Interface Identifier in Stateless Address
   AutoConfiguration [RFC4862] is a parameter; its length SHOULD be
   sufficient for effective randomization for privacy reasons.  For
   example, a /48 might be sufficient.  But operationally we RECOMMEND,
   barring strong considerations to the contrary, using 64-bits for
   SLAAC in order not to discover bugs where 64 was hard-coded, and to
   favor portability of devices and operating systems.

   None the less, there is no reason in theory why an IPv6 node should
   not operate with different interface identfier lengths on different
   physical interfaces.  Thus a correct implementation of SLAAC must in

   fact allow for any prefix length, with the value being a parameter
   per interface.  For instance, the Interface Identifier length in the
   recommended (see [RFC8064]) algorithm for selecting stable interface
   identifiers [RFC7217] is a parameter, rather than a hardcoded value.

6.  Security Considerations

   Assumming that nodes employ unpredictable interface identifiers
   [RFC7721], the subnet size may have an impact on some security and
   privacy properties of a network.  Namely, the smaller the subnet
   size, the more feasible it becomes to perform IPv6 address scans
   [RFC7707] [RFC7721].  For some specific subnets, such as point to
   point links, this may be less of an issue.

   On the other hand, we assume that a number of IPv6 implementations
   fail to enforce limits on the size of some of the data structures
   they employ for communicating with neighboring nodes, such as the
   Neighbor Cache.  In such cases, the use of smaller subnets forces an
   operational limit on such data structures, thus helping mitigate some
   pathological behaviors (such as Neighbor Cache Exhaustion attacks).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
