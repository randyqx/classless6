                 draft-bourbaki-6man-classless-ipv6-01

Abstract

   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
   proposed, none of which has withstood the test of time.  The last
   remnant of IPv6 classful addressing is a rigid network interface
   identifier boundary at /64.  This document removes the fixed position
   of that boundary for interface addressing.

1.  Introduction

   Over the history of the IPv6 protocol, several classful addressing
   models have been proposed.  The most notable example recommended Top-
   Level Aggregation (TLA) and Next-Level Aggregation (NLA) Identifiers
   [RFC2450], but was obsoleted by [RFC3587], leaving a single remnant
   of classful addressing in IPv6: a rigid network interface identifier
   boundary at /64.  This document removes the fixed position of that
   boundary for interface addressing.

   Recent proposed changes to the IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture
   specification [RFC4291] have caused controversy.  While link prefixes
   of varied lengths, e.g. /127, /126, /124, /120, ...  /64 have been
   successfully deployed for many years, glaring mismatches between a
   formal specification and long-standing field deployment practices are
   never wise, not least because of the strong risk of mis-
   implementation, which can easily result in serious operational
   problems.

   This document also clarifies that IPv6 routing subnets may be of any
   length up to 128.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the history of classful
   addressing in IPv4 and why it was abolished [RFC4632].  Of course,
   the acute need to conserve address space that forced the adoption of
   classless addressing for IPv4 does not apply to IPv6, but the
   arguments for operational flexibility in address assignment remain
   compelling.

   It is also assumed that the reader understands IPv6 [RFC2460], the IP
   Version 6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291], the proposed changes to
   RFC4291 [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc4291bis] and RFC2464
   [I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis], [RFC7608] an IPv6 Prefix Length
   Recommendation for Forwarding, and the IETF recommendation for the
   generation of stable Interface Identifiers [RFC8064].

   [I-D.jinmei-6man-prefix-clarify] is also worth reading to clarify
   uses of varying prefix lengths on a single link.

3.  Problems Reinforced by Classful Addressing

   For host computers on local area networks, generation of interface
   identifiers is no longer necessarily bound to layer 2 addresses
   (MACs) [RFC7217] [RFC8064].  Therefore their length, previously fixed
   at 64 bits [RFC7136], is in fact a variably-sized parameter as
   explicitly acknowledged in Section 5.5.3(d) of [RFC4862] which
   states:

      Note that a future revision of the address architecture [RFC4291]
      and a future link-type-specific document, which will still be
      consistent with each other, could potentially allow for an
      interface identifier of length other than the value defined in the
      current documents.  Thus, an implementation should not assume a
      particular constant.  Rather, it should expect any lengths of
      interface identifiers

   As IPv6 use has evolved and grown, it has become evident that it
   faces several scaling and coordination problems.  These problems are
   analogous to allocation and coordination problems that motivated IPv4
   CIDR allocation and later abundant IPv4 PAT, they include:

      Address allocation models for specific counts of fixed length
      subnets to downstream networks or devices from /48 down to /64 are
      based on design assumptions of how subnets are or should be
      allocated and populated within ipv4 networks.

      Hierarchical allocation of fixed-length subnets requires
      coordination between lower / intermediate / upper network
      elements.  It has implicit assumption that policies and size
      allocation allowed at the top of the hierarchy will accommodate
      present and future use cases with fixed length subnet allocation.

      Coordination with upstream networks across administrative domains
      for the allocation of fixed length subnets reveals topology and
      intent that may be private in scope, allowing the upstream
      networks to restrict the topology that may be built.  Policies for
      hierarchical allocation are applied top-down and amount to

      permission to build a particular topology (for example mobile
      device tethering, virtual machine instantiation, containers and so
      on).

      In the case where a device is given a /64 (e.g. mobile phone
      running SLAAC only, not DHCP), there is no protocol allowing them
      to provide downstream routed layer 3 subnets, because all they
      have is a /64.  This applies more to nodes which do not have
      DHCPv6.

4.  Identifier and Subnet Length Statements

   IPv6 unicast interfaces may use any subnet length up to 128 except
   for situations where an Internet Standard document may impose a
   particular length, for example Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) [RFC4862], or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router
   Links [RFC6164].

   Additionally, this document clarifies that a node or router MUST
   support routing of any valid network prefix length, even if SLAAC or
   other standards are in use, because routing could choose to
   differentiate at a different granularity than is used by any such
   automated link local address configuration tools.

5.  Recommendations

   For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link, barring
   other considerations, a /64 is recommended [RFC7136].

   The length of the Interface Identifier in Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] is a parameter; its length SHOULD be
   sufficient for effective randomization for privacy reasons.  For
   example, a /48 might be sufficient.  But operationally we recommend,
   barring strong considerations to the contrary, using 64-bits for
   SLAAC in order not to discover bugs where 64 was hard-coded, and to
   favor portability of devices and operating systems.

   Nonetheless, there is no reason in theory why an IPv6 node should not
   operate with different interface identifier lengths on different
   physical interfaces.  Thus, a correct implementation of SLAAC must in
   fact allow for any prefix length, with the value being a parameter
   per interface.  For instance, the Interface Identifier length in the
   recommended (see [RFC8064]) algorithm for selecting stable interface
   identifiers [RFC7217] is a parameter, rather than a hard-coded value.

6.  Security Considerations

   Assuming that nodes employ unpredictable interface identifiers
   [RFC7721], the subnet size may have an impact on some security and
   privacy properties of a network.  Namely, the smaller the subnet
   size, the more feasible it becomes to perform IPv6 address scans
   [RFC7707] [RFC7721].  For some specific subnets, such as point to
   point links, this may be less of an issue.

   On the other hand, we assume that a number of IPv6 implementations
   fail to enforce limits on the size of some of the data structures
   they employ for communicating with neighboring nodes, such as the
   Neighbor Cache.  In such cases, the use of smaller subnets forces an
   operational limit on such data structures, thus helping mitigate some
   pathological behaviors (such as Neighbor Cache Exhaustion attacks).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
